/*
In this code we are going to use cout which is a member of the iostream library std namespace.
We can access the cout in 3 different ways.

1. using namespace std;

This way you have access to whole std namespace throughout your code.

2. using std::cout;

This way you have access only to cout throughout your code.

3. std::cout

This way you are accessing the cout only at the line it is used on.
